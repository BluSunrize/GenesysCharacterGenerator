<h1>Typodermic End User License Agreement</h1><p>By downloading this font package (&#8220;licensed fonts&#8221;), you are agreeing to be bound by the terms of this agreement. This agreement, in conjunction with the receipt that accompanies each purchase from MyFonts.com (&#8220;MyFonts&#8221;), constitutes the complete agreement between you and MyFonts. </p>
<p>1. Allowed uses You may use the licensed fonts to create images on any surface such as computer screens, paper, web pages, photographs, movie credits, printed material, T-shirts, and other surfaces. You may use the licensed fonts to create EPS files or other scalable drawings provided that such files are only used by the household or company licensing the font. </p>
<p>2. Number of users The maximum number of simultaneous users is specified in the applicable receipt. All users must belong to the same company or household purchasing the licensed fonts. </p>
<p>3. Third parties You may provide the licensed fonts to a graphic designer, printer or other service bureau that is working on your behalf only if they agree to use the licensed fonts exclusively for your work, agree to the terms of this agreement, and retain no copies of the licensed fonts on completion of the work. You may not provide the licensed fonts or make them accessible to any other third parties. </p>
<p>4. Embedding Embedding of the licensed fonts in documents (e.g. PDF files) is permitted for viewing and printing, but not for editing. If someone at a remote location wants to edit a document which contains embedded fonts, they must purchase their own license. Internal corporate documents with embedded fonts may of course be edited on licensed workstations. You may not under embed the licensed fonts into software or hardware products. Such use requires a different license which may be offered through MyFonts. Please contact help@myfonts.com for further information. </p>
<p>5. Modifications You may modify typesetting produced by the licensed fonts in any way you see fit. You may also modify the licensed fonts for your own personal or internal business use, but you may not distribute, or transfer your adaptations; for instance, (a) you may not make customized versions of the licensed fonts for use by your clients, (b) you may not adapt, or merge the licensed fonts to create hybrid Fonts for resale. Each workstation where a modified licensed fonts is installed shall be counted as one of your permitted number of users. </p>

<p>8. Product Upgrades MyFonts may, from time to time, update the licensed fonts. Product upgrade pricing may apply. </p>
